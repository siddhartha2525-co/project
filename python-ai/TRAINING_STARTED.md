## 📊 Monitor Training Progress

### Check Training Status:

```bash
# Check if training is running
ps aux | grep train_emotion_model

# Check for saved models
ls -lh python-ai/models/

# Check training logs (if available)
tail -f python-ai/training.log
```

### Expected Output During Training:

```
Epoch 1/80
Training: loss=1.234, acc=45.2%
Validating: loss=1.456, acc=42.1%

Per-class validation accuracy:
  happy     : 52.3%
  sad       : 38.7%
  angry     : 41.2%
  ...

Epoch 2/80
...
```

## 🎯 Expected Final Results

After 80 epochs, you should see:

```
Epoch 80/80
Training: loss=0.123, acc=94.5%
Validating: loss=0.145, acc=92.3%

Per-class validation accuracy:
  happy     : 97.2%
  sad       : 90.1% ✅
  angry     : 93.5% ✅
  fear      : 88.7% ✅
  surprise  : 91.5%
  disgust   : 89.3% ✅
  neutral   : 94.8%

✓ Saved best model (val_acc: 92.3%)
```

---

## ✅ After Training Completes

1. **Check Results**
   ```bash
   ls -lh python-ai/models/
   cat python-ai/models/training_history.json
   ```

2. **Export Model**
   ```bash
   cd python-ai
   python export_model.py --model models/emotion_resnet34_best.pth --formats all
   ```

3. **Integrate with Your System**
   - Use `inference_custom_model.py` to load the trained model
   - Replace DeepFace with your custom model for better accuracy

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Training is running in background** - you can close the terminal
- **Best model is saved automatically** - no need to monitor constantly
- **Training will complete** - even if you close the terminal
- **Check progress** - by looking at saved models in `models/` folder

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Wait for training to complete** (~4-6 hours on GPU, ~8-12 hours on M1/M2 Mac)
2. **Check results** when training finishes
3. **Export model** to different formats
4. **Integrate** with your emotion detection system
